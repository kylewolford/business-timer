The source code for an android app I am co-developing.

Download instructions (note: this requires Android Studio to be installed on your computer):

- Download this git repo (using the "Clone or download" menu, select "Download ZIP"). Unzip the file.
- Using Android Studio, go to File -> Open... and navigate to where you extracted the ZIP file.
- You should be able to open the unzipped folder in Android Studio and run it natively in Android Studio.
